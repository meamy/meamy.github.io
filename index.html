          <p class="abstract">
The phase folding optimization is a circuit optimization used in many quantum compilers as a fast and effective way of reducing the number of high-cost gates in a quantum circuit. However, existing formulations of the optimization rely on an exact, linear algebraic representation of the circuit, restricting the optimization to being performed on straightline quantum circuits or basic blocks in a larger quantum program.<br><br>

We show that the phase folding optimization can be re-cast as an affine relation analysis, which allows the direct application of classical techniques for affine relations to extend phase folding to quantum programs with arbitrarily complicated classical control flow including nested loops and procedure calls. Through the lens of relational analysis, we show that the optimization can be powered-up by substituting other classical relational domains, particularly ones for non-linear relations which are useful in analyzing circuits involving classical arithmetic. To increase the precision of our analysis and infer non-linear relations from gate sets involving only linear operations ---  such as Clifford+T --- we show that the sum-over-paths technique can be used to extract precise symbolic transition relations for straightline circuits. Our experiments show that our methods are able to generate and use non-trivial loop invariants for quantum program optimization, as well as achieve some optimizations of common circuits which were previously attainable only by hand.

            Implementations of Roetteler's shifted bent function algorithm have
in recent years been used to test and benchmark both classical simulation algorithms
and quantum hardware.
These circuits have many favorable properties, including a tunable amount of non-Clifford
resources and a deterministic output, and moreover do not belong to any class of
quantum circuits which is known to be efficiently simulable.
We show that this family of circuits can in fact be simulated in 
polynomial time via symbolic path integrals.
We do so by endowing symbolic sums with a confluent rewriting system
and show that this rewriting system suffices to reduce the circuit's path integral to the hidden shift in polynomial-time.
We hence resolve an open conjecture about the efficient simulability of this class of circuits.

            We give a sound and complete equational theory for $3$-qubit quantum circuits over the Toffoli-Hadamard gate set $\{ X, CX, CCX, H\}$.
That is, we introduce a collection of true equations among Toffoli-Hadamard circuits on three qubits that is sufficient to derive any other true equation between such circuits.
To obtain this equational theory, we first consider circuits over the Toffoli-$K$ gate set $\{ X, CX, CCX, K\}$, where $K=H\otimes H$.
The Toffoli-Hadamard and Toffoli-$K$ gate sets appear similar, but they are crucially different on exactly three qubits.
Indeed, in this case, the former generates an infinite group of operators, while the latter generates the finite group of automorphisms of the well-known $E_8$ lattice.
We take advantage of this fact, and of the theory of automorphism groups of lattices, to obtain a sound and complete collection of equations for Toffoli-$K$ circuits.
We then extend this equational theory to one for Toffoli-Hadamard circuits by leveraging prior work of Li \textit{et al.} on Toffoli-Hadamard operators.

           Let $n\geq 8$ be an integer divisible by 4. The Clifford-cyclotomic gate set $\mathcal{G}_n$ is the universal gate set obtained by extending the Clifford gates with the $z$-rotation $T_n = \mathrm{diag}(1,\zeta_n)$, where $\zeta_n$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity. In this note, we show that, when $n$ is a power of 2, a multiqubit unitary matrix $U$ can be exactly represented by a circuit over $\mathcal{G}_n$ if and only if the entries of $U$ belong to the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\zeta_n]$. We moreover show that $\log(n)-2$ ancillas are always sufficient to construct a circuit for $U$. Our results generalize prior work to an infinite family of gate sets and show that the limitations that apply to single-qubit unitaries, for which the correspondence between Clifford-cyclotomic operators and matrices over $\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\zeta_n]$ fails for all but finitely many values of $n$, can be overcome through the use of ancillas.

           In order for quantum computations to be done as efficiently as possible it is important to optimise the number of gates used in the underlying quantum circuits. In this paper we find that many gate optimisation problems for approximately universal quantum circuits are NP-hard. In particular, we show that optimising the T-count or T-depth in Clifford+T circuits, which are important metrics for the computational cost of executing fault-tolerant quantum computations, is NP-hard by reducing the problem to Boolean satisfiability. With a similar argument we show that optimising the number of CNOT gates or Hadamard gates in a Clifford+T circuit is also NP-hard. Again varying the same argument we also establish the hardness of optimising the number of Toffoli gates in a reversible classical circuit. We find an upper bound to the problems of T-count and Toffoli-count of $\text{NP}^{\text{NQP}}$.
	Finally, we also show that for any non-Clifford gate $G$ it is NP-hard to optimise the $G$-count over the Clifford+$G$ gate set, where we only have to match the target unitary within some small distance in the operator norm.

          Vilmart recently gave a complete equational theory for the balanced sum-over-paths over 
          Toffoli-Hadamard circuits, and by extension Clifford+$\mathrm{diag}(1, \zeta_{2^k})$ circuits. 
          Their theory is based on the phase-free ZH-calculus which crucially omits the average rule of 
          the full ZH-calculus, dis-allowing the local summation of amplitudes. Here we study the 
          question of completeness in unbalanced path sums which naturally support local summation. We 
          give a concrete syntax for the unbalanced sum-over-paths and show that, together with symbolic 
          multilinear algebra and the interference rule, various formulations of the average and ortho 
          rules of the ZH-calculus are sufficient to give complete equational theories over arbitrary

          The matrices that can be exactly represented by a circuit over the Toffoli-Hadamard gate 
          set are the orthogonal matrices of the form $M/\sqrt{2}{}^k$, where $M$ is an integer matrix 
          and $k$ is a nonnegative integer. The exact synthesis problem for this gate set is the 
          problem of constructing a circuit for a given such matrix. Existing methods produce circuits 
          consisting of $O(2^n\log(n)k)$ gates, where $n$ is the dimension of the matrix. In this 
          paper, we provide two improved synthesis methods. First, we show that a technique introduced 
          by Kliuchnikov in 2013 for Clifford+$T$ circuits can be straightforwardly adapted to 
          Toffoli-Hadamard circuits, reducing the complexity of the synthesized circuit from 
          $O(2^n\log(n)k)$ to $O(n^2\log(n)k)$. Then, we present an alternative synthesis method of 
          similarly improved cost, but whose application is restricted to circuits on no more than 
          three qubits. Our results also apply to orthogonal matrices over the dyadic fractions, which 
          correspond to circuits using the 2-qubit gate $H\otimes H$, rather than the usual 
          single-qubit Hadamard gate $H$.

          If a set $\mathbb{G}$ of quantum gates is countable, then the operators that can be 
          exactly represented by a circuit over $\mathbb{G}$ form a strict subset of the 
          collection of all unitary operators. When $\mathbb{G}$ is universal, one circumvents 
          this limitation by resorting to repeated gate approximations: every occurrence of a 
          gate which cannot be exactly represented over $\mathbb{G}$ is replaced by an 
          approximating circuit. Here, we introduce catalytic embeddings, which provide an 
          alternative to repeated gate approximations. With catalytic embeddings, approximations 
          are relegated to the preparation of a fixed number of reusable resource states called 
          catalysts. Because the catalysts only need to be prepared once, when catalytic embeddings 
          exist they always produce shorter circuits, in the limit of increasing gate count and 
          target precision. In the present paper, we lay the foundations of the theory of catalytic 
          embeddings and we establish several of their structural properties. In addition, we 
          provide methods to design catalytic embeddings, showing that their construction can be 
          reduced to that of a single fixed matrix when the gates involved have entries in 
          well-behaved rings of algebraic numbers. Finally, we showcase some concrete examples and 
          applications. Notably, we show that catalytic embeddings generalize a technique previously 
          used to implement the Quantum Fourier Transform over the Clifford+$T$ gate set with 
          $O(n)$ gate approximations.

            Path sums are a convenient symbolic formalism for quantum operations with applications to
            the simulation, optimization, and verification of quantum protocols. Unlike quantum 
            circuits, path sums are not limited to unitary operations, but can express arbitrary 
            linear ones. Two problems, therefore, naturally arise in the study of path sums: the
            unitarity problem and the extraction problem. The former is the problem of deciding
            whether a given path sum represents a unitary operator. The latter is the problem of
            constructing a quantum circuit, given a path sum promised to represent a unitary
            operator.<br>
            We show that the unitarity problem is co-NP-hard in general, but that it is in P when
            restricted to Clifford path sums. We then provide an algorithm to synthesize a Clifford
            circuit from a unitary Clifford path sum. The circuits produced by our extraction algorithm
            are of the form C1HC2, where C1 and C2 are Hadamard-free circuits and H is a layer of
            Hadamard gates. We also provide a heuristic generalization of our extraction algorithm to
            arbitrary path sums. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to succeed, it often succeeds
            and typically produces natural looking circuits. Alongside applications to the optimization
            and decompilation of quantum circuits, we demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by
            synthesizing the standard quantum Fourier transform directly from a path sum.

            The reversible implementation of classical functions accounts
            for the bulk of most known quantum algorithms. As a result,
            a number of reversible circuit constructions over the Clifford+$T$
            gate set have been developed in recent years which use both the state and 
            phase spaces, or $X$ and $Z$ bases, to reduce circuit costs beyond what is possible
            at the strictly classical level. We study and generalize two particular classes of these
            constructions: relative phase circuits, including Giles and Selinger's 
            multiply-controlled $iX$ gates and Maslov's $4$ qubit Toffoli gate,
            and measurement-assisted circuits, including Jones' Toffoli gate and 
            Gidney's temporary logical-AND.
            In doing so, we introduce general methods for
            implementing classical functions up to phase and for
            measurement-assisted termination of temporary values. 
            We then apply these
            techniques to find novel $T$-count efficient constructions of
            some classical functions in space-constrained regimes, notably multiply-controlled Toffoli gates and 
            temporary products.

          We describe 'staq', a full-stack quantum processing toolkit written in standard C++. 
          'staq' is a quantum compiler toolkit, comprising of tools that range from quantum 
          optimizers and translators to physical mappers for quantum devices with restricted 
          connectives. The design of 'staq' is inspired from the UNIX philosophy of "less is more", 
          i.e. 'staq' achieves complex functionality via combining (piping) small tools, 
          each of which performs a single task using the most advanced current state-of-the-art 
          methods. We also provide a set of illustrative benchmarks.

          Kliuchnikov, Maslov, and Mosca proved in 2012 that a $2 \times 2$ unitary matrix $V$ 
          can be exactly represented by a single-qubit Clifford+$T$ circuit if and only if the 
          entries of $V$ belong to the ring $\mathbb{Z}\left[1/\sqrt{2}, i\right]$. Later that 
          year, Giles and Selinger showed that the same restriction applies to matrices that 
          can be exactly represented by a multi-qubit Clifford+$T$ circuit. These number-theoretic 
          characterizations shed new light upon the structure of Clifford+$T$ circuits and led 
          to remarkable developments in the field of quantum compiling. In the present paper, 
          we provide number-theoretic characterizations for certain restricted Clifford+$T$ circuits 
          by considering unitary matrices over subrings of $\mathbb{Z}\left[1/\sqrt{2}, i\right]$. 
          We focus on the subrings $\mathbb{Z}\left[1/2\right]$, $\mathbb{Z}\left[1/\sqrt{2}\right]$, 
          $\mathbb{Z}\left[1/\sqrt{\mbox{-}2}\right]$, and $\mathbb{Z}\left[1/2,i\right]$, and we 
          prove that unitary matrices with entries in these rings correspond to circuits over 
          well-known universal gate sets. In each case, the desired gate set is obtained by 
          extending the set of classical reversible gates $\{X,CX,CCX\}$ with an analogue of the 
          Hadamard gate and an optional phase gate.

            One of the most fundamental aspects of quantum circuit design is the concept of 
            <em>families</em> of circuits parametrized by an instance size. As in classical programming, 
            metaprogramming allows the programmer to write entire families of circuits simultaneously, 
            an ability which is of particular importance in the context of quantum computing as 
            algorithms frequently use arithmetic over non-standard word lengths. In this work, we 
            introduce metaQASM, a typed extension of the openQASM language supporting the metaprogramming 
            of circuit families. Our language and type system, built around a lightweight implementation 
            of <em>sized types</em>, supports subtyping over register sizes and is moreover type-safe. 
            In particular, we prove that our system is strongly normalizing, and as such any well-typed 
            metaQASM program can be statically unrolled into a finite circuit.

              The design and compilation of correct, efficient quantum circuits is integral to the 
              future operation of quantum computers. This thesis makes contributions to the problems 
              of optimizing and verifying quantum circuits, with an emphasis on the development of formal 
              models for such purposes. We also present software implementations of these methods, which 
              together form a full stack of tools for the design of optimized, formally verified 
              quantum oracles.<br><br>

              On the optimization side, we study methods for the optimization of $R_Z$ and CNOT gates 
              in Clifford+$R_Z$ circuits. We develop a general, efficient optimization algorithm called 
              <em>phase folding</em>, which reduces the number of $R_Z$ gates without increasing any 
              metrics by computing its <em>phase polynomial</em>. This algorithm can further be combined 
              with synthesis techniques for CNOT-dihedral operators to optimize circuits with respect to 
              particular costs. We then study the optimal synthesis problem for CNOT-dihedral operators 
              from the perspectives of $R_Z$ and CNOT gate optimization. In the case of $R_Z$ gate 
              optimization, we show that the optimal synthesis problem is polynomial-time equivalent to 
              minimum-distance decoding in certain Reed-Muller codes. For the CNOT optimization problem, 
              we show that the optimal synthesis problem is at least as hard as a combinatorial problem 
              related to Gray codes. In both cases, we develop heuristics for the optimal synthesis 
              problem, which together with phase folding reduces $T$ counts by 42% and CNOT counts by 22% 
              across a suite of real-world benchmarks.<br><br>

              From the perspective of formal verification, we make two contributions. The first is the 
              development of a formal model of quantum circuits with ancillary bits based on the Feynman 
              path integral, along with a concrete verification algorithm. The path integral model, with 
              some syntactic sugar, further doubles as a natural specification language for quantum 
              computations. Our experiments show some practical circuits with up to hundreds of qubits 
              can be efficiently verified. Our second contribution is a formally verified, optimizing 
              compiler for reversible circuits. The compiler compiles a classical, irreversible language 
              to reversible circuits, with a formal, machine-checked proof of correctness written in the 
              proof assistant F$^\star$. The compiler is structured as a partial evaluator, allowing 
              verification to be carried out significantly faster than previous results.

              In this paper, we study the close relationship between Reed-Muller codes and single-qubit 
              phase gates from the perspective of $T$-count optimization. We prove that minimizing the 
              number of $T$ gates in an $n$-qubit quantum circuit over CNOT and $T$, together with the 
              Clifford group powers of $T$, corresponds to finding a minimum distance decoding of a 
              length $2^n-1$ binary vector in the order $n-4$ punctured Reed-Muller code. Moreover, we 
              show that the problems are polynomially equivalent in the length of the code. As a 
              consequence, we derive an algorithm for the optimization of $T$-count in quantum circuits 
              based on Reed-Muller decoders, along with a new upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on the number of 
              $T$ gates required to implement an $n$-qubit unitary over CNOT and $T$ gates. We further 
              generalize this result to show that minimizing small angle rotations corresponds to 
              decoding lower order binary Reed-Muller codes. In particular, we show that minimizing the 
              number of $R_Z(2\pi/m)$ gates for any integer $m$ is equivalent to minimum distance 
              decoding in $\mathcal{RM}(n - k - 1, n)^*$, where $k$ is the highest power of $2$ dividing 
              $m$.<br><br>

              (i) an API for quantum programming based on an easy-to-use language named Blackbird; (ii) 
              a suite of three virtual quantum computer backends, built in NumPy and TensorFlow, each

              various backends, including the three built-in simulators, and -- in the near future -- 
              photonic quantum information processors. The library also contains examples of several

              We introduce a framework for the formal specification and verification of quantum circuits 
              based on the Feynman path integral. Our formalism, built around exponential sums of 
              polynomial functions, provides a structured and natural way of specifying quantum 
              operations, particularly for quantum implementations of classical functions. Verification 
              of circuits over all levels of the Clifford hierarchy with respect to either a

              sums with free variables. Our algorithm is further shown to give a polynomial-time 
              decision procedure for checking the equivalence of Clifford group circuits. We evaluate 
              our methods by performing automated verification of optimized Clifford+$T$ circuits with 
              up to 100 qubits and thousands of $T$ gates, as well as the functional verification of

              We study the problem of CNOT-optimal quantum circuit synthesis over gate sets consisting 
              of CNOT and $Z$-basis rotations of arbitrary angles. We show that the circuit-polynomial 
              correspondence relates such circuits to Fourier expansions of pseudo-Boolean functions, 
              and that for certain classes of functions this expansion uniquely determines the minimum 
              CNOT cost of an implementation. As a corollary we prove that CNOT minimization over CNOT 
              and phase gates is at least as hard as synthesizing a CNOT-optimal circuit computing a 
              set of parities of its inputs. We then show that this problem is NP-complete for two 
              restricted cases where all CNOT gates are required to have the same target, and where the 
              circuit inputs are encoded in a larger state space. The latter case has applications to 
              CNOT optimization over more general Clifford+$T$ circuits.

              We give a finite presentation by generators and relations of the unitary
              operators expressible over the {CNOT, $T$} gate set, also known as
              CNOT-dihedral operators. To this end, we introduce a notion of

              CNOT-dihedral operator admits a unique normal form. Moreover, we
              show that in the presence of certain structural rules only finitely
              many circuit identities are required to reduce an arbitrary

              The generation of reversible circuits from high-level code is an 
              important problem in several application domains, including low-power 
              electronics and quantum computing.  Existing tools compile and optimize 
              reversible circuits for various metrics, such as the overall circuit size 
              or the total amount of space required to implement a given function 
              reversibly. However, little effort has been spent on verifying the 
              correctness of the results, an issue of particular importance in quantum 
              computing. There, compilation allows not only mapping to hardware, but 
              also the estimation of resources required to implement a given quantum 
              algorithm, a process that is crucial for identifying which algorithms will 
              outperform their classical counterparts. We present a reversible circuit 
              compiler called ReVerC, which has been formally verified in F$^\star$ and 
              compiles circuits that operate correctly with respect to the input program. 
              Our compiler compiles the REVS language

              We investigate the cost of Grover's quantum search algorithm when used in the
              context of pre-image attacks on the SHA-2 and SHA-3 families of
              hash functions.  Our cost model assumes that the attack is run on a surface
              code based fault-tolerant quantum computer. Our estimates rely on a time-area
              metric that costs the number of logical qubits times the depth of the circuit
              in units of surface code cycles.  As a surface code cycle involves a
              significant classical processing stage, our cost estimates allow for crude, but
              direct, comparisons of classical and quantum algorithms.

              We exhibit a circuit for a pre-image attack on SHA-256 that is
              approximately $2^{153.8}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately
              $2^{12.6}$ logical qubits. This yields an overall cost of $2^{166.4}$
              logical-qubit-cycles.  Likewise we exhibit a SHA3-256 circuit that is
              approximately $2^{146.5}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately
              $2^{20}$ logical qubits for a total cost of, again, $2^{166.5}$
              logical-qubit-cycles. Both attacks require on the order of $2^{128}$ queries in
              a quantum black-box model, hence our results suggest that executing these
              attacks may be as much as $275$ billion times more expensive than one would
              expect from the simple query analysis.

              The Clifford+$T$ quantum gate library has attracted much interest in the
              design of quantum circuits, particularly since the contained operations can be
              implemented in a fault-tolerant manner.  Since fault tolerant implementations
              of the $T$ gate have very high latency, synthesis and optimization are aiming
              at minimizing the number of $T$ stages, referred to as the $T$-depth.

              <br><br>In this paper, we present an approach to map mixed polarity multiple
              controlled Toffoli gates into Clifford+$T$ quantum circuits. Our approach is
              based on the multiple control Toffoli mapping algorithms proposed by Barenco
              <em>et al.</em>, which are given $T$-depth optimized Clifford+$T$ translations.
              Experiments show that our approach leads
              to a significant $T$-depth reduction of 54% on average.

              provides several new and tighter bounds.  Several synthesis approaches and

              Most work in quantum circuit optimization has been performed in isolation from the 
              results of quantum fault-tolerance. Here we present a polynomial-time algorithm for 
              optimizing quantum circuits that takes the actual implementation of fault-tolerant 
              logical gates into consideration. Our algorithm re-synthesizes quantum circuits 
              composed of Clifford group and $T$ gates, the latter being typically the most costly 
              gate in fault-tolerant models, e.g., those based on the Steane or surface codes, with 
              the purpose of minimizing both $T$-count and $T$-depth. A major feature of the algorithm 
              is the ability to re-synthesize circuits with ancillae at effectively no additional cost, 
              allowing space-time trade-offs to be easily explored. The tested benchmarks show up to 
              65.7% reduction in $T$-count and up to 87.6% reduction in $T$-depth without ancillae, or 
              99.7% reduction in $T$-depth using ancillae.

              We present an algorithm for computing depth-optimal decompositions of logical
              operations, leveraging a <em>meet-in-the-middle</em> technique to provide
              a significant speed-up over simple brute force algorithms. As an
              illustration of our method we implemented
              this algorithm and found factorizations of the commonly used quantum logical operations into
              elementary gates in the Clifford$+T$ set. In particular, we report a decomposition of the
              Toffoli gate over the set of Clifford and $T$ gates.  Our decomposition achieves a total $T$-
              depth of 3, thereby providing a 40% reduction over the previously
              best known decomposition for the Toffoli gate. Due to the size of the search space the
              algorithm is only practical for small parameters, such as the number of qubits, and the 
              number of gates in an optimal implementation.
